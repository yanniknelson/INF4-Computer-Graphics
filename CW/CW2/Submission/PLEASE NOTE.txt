Please note that to change the number of samples taken you can add a 3rd arguemnt,
though this value must be square if jittering is enabled

Additionally, in order to switch between jittered and not jittered, there are 
'#ifdef's in the raytracer.cpp and arealight.cpp files that enable or disable
jittering for the the thin lens and arealight respectively. To switch you will
need to comment or uncomment these and recompile. Jittering is enabled in the 
code you have been provided.
